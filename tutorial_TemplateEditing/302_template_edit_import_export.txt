NOTE: 
(1) template.json is stored at 
<images>/tmp/template.json

(2) Draft draw and template polygon points have seperate memory storage, 
All your edit is carried out on draft drawing.
Thus, in the template panel, when the final shape edit is finished, 
you must use "import..." to update the final results to the template item.

(3) You can use "export..." to export current template poly to the draft.
To export template shape, you must select the "polygon".
