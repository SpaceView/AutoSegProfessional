NOTE:
(1) the replaced image file result is stored at <image>/patched/*.png
(2) the template location is <image>/tmp/template.json, this sub-path is fixed under your main image path.
(3) Sequence and position of landmarks must match exactly, in this example, the transistor has 3 landmarks with sequence numbered clockwise (0, 1, 2).

General Introduction:

Problem
ref. example_01_xxx.png
Image you need to replace some "unwanted area" with random background;
but, your foreground components have very complicated shapes;
then, how can you get the correct background where no foreground is involved?

step(1)
in "Replacement Setting", 
select the radio button "scaled template based on landmarks"

step(2)
in the "Template" panel, import the correct template;
edit one if you don't have it.

step(3)
make an area mask the right select the "ReplaceWithBackground"

Done!

-----------------------
replacement principle, 
introduction (1)
ref. example_02_xxx.png
get the annotated area with template match;
How to match the template?
In this example, since our annotation item has 3 landmarks, then our template must have 3 landmarks too, (ref. default_template_with_landmarks); and we do affine transformation (shift, rotation, & scale) to match the template.
Surely the matched area is the foreground.

introduction (2)
ref. example_03_xxx.png
Now the black area is the background area, we randomly select this area from the image to replace the "unwanted area".
