Tutorial: Generate reasonable rotated images with landmarks annotations.
In this batch conversion, we have 3 images, each object inside the image is annotated with 4 landmarks.
For each image, we generate a rotated one per 10degrees. thus we will generate 3 * (360/10 - 1) = 105 rotated images.
After rotation, some landmarks will be outside of the image, which is NOT good. On most occasions, landmarks annotations should be complete; therefore, we remove all the annotations if any of whose landmarks is in the outside of the image.
The problem is, if we remove the landmark, but part of the object is still inside the image, which will give a big influence to the training result of the machine learning, since without annotation these partial positive objects will be treat as negative background, but that is not true.
Our method is, replace this partial positive objects with random background from the image.
This is a huge workload if you manually handle them one by one.
While with AutoSeg Professional, you can finish all of them with a single click.
Let's go & check!
