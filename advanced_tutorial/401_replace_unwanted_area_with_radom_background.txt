Sometime you may need to replace part of the image, which might be difficult to annotate, with some background,
you can do the following:

(1) annotate the needed parts, they could be polygon, or area, or landmarks (this will make a convex polygon by Autoseg automatically
(2) new an area annotation item, this item is assistant, you can delete it after work done
(3) use any tools to select areas need to be replaced
(4) right click the above assistant item, select the "RepalceWith..." menu item
(5) image will be saved to the subfolder "<image>/Patched/*.png"

Done!
