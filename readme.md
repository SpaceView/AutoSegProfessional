# Software tools Updated

AutoSegProfessional is a free software for image annotation.

It can handle various annotation in a very fast and handy manner.

It has much more function than you have ever expected. 

Let's dig them out!

# NOTE:
  the reason of delayed update is that, the software is written according to some special habits, 
  and there are lots of improvements waiting for update!
  Now it seems I don't have time for all of it.
  Hope you enjoy it. Everybody can send me notes when there are problems, just I cannot promise immediate update.

  I developed this software tools in 2018, for segment annotation it still has the highest accuracy as far as I know.
  The segmentation tutorial is at
