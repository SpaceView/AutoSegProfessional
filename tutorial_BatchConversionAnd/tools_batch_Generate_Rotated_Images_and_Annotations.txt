How to extend your annotations and images in AI model, rotating relevant images and annotations should be a good method.
This tutorial tells you how to rotate images and relevant annotations.

You can see that, we have nearly 60 annotated image, after rotation, each image generated 35 rotated images, thus in total 35*59 = 2065 images.

NOTE: Put images & annotations under default folder to avoid any setting
 (the checkbox "annotations in default coco folder" should be checked by default), 
such as 
<imagefolder>
<imagefolder>/coco/<annotations>.json
<imagefolder>/cat/<categories>.json

otherwise, you need to do 2 things
(1), ANNOTATIONS should be in the same folder as image
(2), You must import CATEGORIES in advance in the main categories panel to avoid auto removal of annotations, since any annotation cannot find corresponding categories will be removed automatically.
