NOTE: Put images & annotations under default folder to avoid any setting, otherwise, 
such as (the checkbox "annotations in default coco folder" should be check by default)
<imagefolder>
<imagefolder>/coco/<annotations>.json
<imagefolder>/cat/<categories>.json

otherwise, you need to do 2 things
(1), ANNOTATIONS should be in the same folder as image
(2), You must import CATEGORIES in the main categories panel to avoid auto removal of annotations, since any annotation cannot find corresponding categories will be removed automatically.
